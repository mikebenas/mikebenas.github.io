                Project has been engaged by the National Health Services (NHS) in England to address the issue of missed general practitioner (GP) appointments,
                which incur significant costs for the healthcare system. The objective is to gain a better understanding of the reasons behind missed appointments 
                and develop data-informed strategies to reduce or eliminate them. The NHS recognizes the need for investigation and solutions rather than resorting 
                to punitive measures, as emphasized by Professor Philip Banfield, the chair of The British Medical Association (BMA).

              The project aims to provide financial and social benefits by tackling this problem. 
              As part of the initial phase, I focused on data exploration, data wrangling, and visualizations 
              to identify potential trends in the available datasets. 
              The key questions posed by the NHS include assessing the adequacy of staff and capacity 
              within the networks and determining the actual utilization of resources.

              In addition, my analysis will encompass various aspects, such as understanding the distribution of locations, 
              service settings, context types, national categories, and appointment statuses within the datasets. I also examined the date 
              range of the provided data and identify service settings that reported the highest number of appointments during specific periods. 
              Furthermore, I analyzed the monthly and seasonal trends, observing patterns in appointment numbers across different service settings, 
              context types, and national categories. Additionally, have explored the top trending hashtags (#) on Twitter related to healthcare in the UK.

              By answering a set of agreed questions and examining the data, i provided valuable insights and recommendations for the NHS. 
              This project enabled me to contribute to the development of effective strategies to optimize staff and resource allocation, 
              ultimately reducing missed appointments and improving the overall efficiency of the healthcare system.
