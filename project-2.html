                In the given case study, the individual was provided with data from a 
                manufacturer and retailer known as Turtle Games. Turtle Games operates 
                globally and offers a range of products, including books, toys, board games, 
                and video games. The individual was tasked with analyzing the company's 
                sales data and customer reviews to gain insights into overall sales performance 
                and identify areas for improvement.<br>
                To conduct the data analysis and present the findings, the individual 
                utilized R/RStudio and Python as the primary tools.<br>
                The analysis also encompassed the examination of the following key areas:<br>
                •	How customers earn and accumulate loyalty points.<br>
                •	How different customer segments within the customer base can be 
                targeted for specific market strategies.<br>
                •	How social data, such as customer reviews, can be utilized to shape marketing campaigns.<br>
                •	The impact of each product on sales performance.<br>
                •	The reliability of the data, considering factors like normal distribution, skewness, and kurtosis.<br>
                •	Identifying any potential relationships between sales in North America, Europe, and the global market.<br>

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Based on the findings presented in Figures 1-3, it is 
                evident that the r-squared values for all three models are considerably low. 
                Specifically, the r-squared values are 0.45, 0.38, and 0.002 for spending score 
                vs. loyalty points, renumeration vs. loyalty points, and age vs. loyalty points, 
                respectively. A higher r-squared value, closer to 1, indicates a better fit of the 
                regression model and explains a larger proportion of the total variation in the data.
                <br>
                The scatter plots reveal a slight positive relationship or linearity between spending 
                score vs. loyalty points and renumeration vs. loyalty points. The regression lines in 
                the plots help visualize this connection. However, no discernible relationship exists 
                between age and loyalty points, suggesting that further exploration in that direction 
                is unnecessary.
                <br>
                Considering the involvement of multiple variables, 
                it might be beneficial to consider a multiple linear regression model instead.
                <br>
                Expanding upon the analysis conducted with the linear regression models, 
                let's focus on the utility of renumeration and spending scores in identifying 
                distinct groups within the customer base for targeted market segmentation. 
                To accomplish this, we can employ k-means clustering.
                <br>
                To determine the optimal number of clusters for our dataset, 
                we can utilize the Elbow or Silhouette methods. These methods indicate that 
                testing out 4-6 clusters would be appropriate.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Based on the analysis and evaluation of the methods and models mentioned above, 
                it can be concluded that utilizing 5 clusters yields the most distinct separation 
                and grouping. It is important to note that this selection is subject to some degree 
                of subjectivity, as unsupervised models like k-means clustering do not provide predetermined
                labels. Without expertise in the specific field, determining the ideal labels for the clusters becomes challenging and uncertain. This is recognized as one of the limitations of unsupervised models, where 
                the interpretation of results can be subjective, especially when clear and definitive labels are not available.

              <br> 
              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Upon observing the k-means model depicted in Figure 6, it becomes evident that the 
                clusters/groups exhibit well-defined boundaries, with minimal overlap among the data 
                points from different clusters. The characteristics of each cluster are as follows:<br>
                - Cluster 1 (red): Represents a higher income group that spends more.<br>
                - Cluster 2 (green): Corresponds to an average income group with average spending habits.<br>
                - Cluster 3 (blue): Represents a higher income group that spends less.<br>
                - Cluster 4 (black): Represents a lower income group that spends more.<br>
                - Cluster 5 (orange): Corresponds to a lower income group that spends less.<br>
                To gain deeper insights into customer reviews, Natural Language Processing (NLP) 
                techniques can be employed. Conducting sentiment analysis allows us to identify the 15 most 
                commonly used words, as well as the top 20 positive and negative reviews received. By importing 
                and cleaning the data, we were able to tokenize the words and generate a word cloud, aiding in 
                better understanding the sentiment expressed in the reviews.

              <p class="project-details__desc-para">
                Upon analyzing the word cloud, it becomes evident that the prominently featured 
                words are predominantly positive in nature. To validate this observation, we 
                proceeded to plot the top 15 most frequently used words (Figure 8). Additionally, 
                a histogram was created to illustrate the sentiment score polarity (Figure 9). 
                These visualizations serve as further confirmation that the majority of the sentiment 
                expressed in the reviews is positive.

              The aforementioned visualizations indeed validate the existence of 
              a positive sentiment towards the products, and the polarity extends 
              beyond the neutral and positive ends of the sentiment scale.<br>
              Furthermore, we successfully presented the top 20 positive and negative reviews. 
              However, it is important to acknowledge one of the limitations of 
              utilizing Natural Language Processing (NLP), which lies in the potential for 
              incorrect interpretations of words or reviews. Figure 10 illustrates this issue 
              when examining the list of the top 20 negative reviews. It becomes apparent 
              that some of the reviews are actually positive in nature, but the NLP model 
              has erroneously classified them as negative. This highlights the importance 
              of cautious interpretation and manual review when working with NLP results to 
              account for potential misclassifications.

              When considering the sales data, it is challenging to precisely determine the specific 
              impact of a product on overall sales based solely on the available data. This limitation 
              arises from the absence of sales trend data over time, as our dataset only includes 
              information for the year each product was released.<br>
              Nevertheless, by grouping the data according to the "Product" category, 
              we can identify the highest and lowest selling products within the two regions. 
              This analysis enables the marketing team to focus their efforts on promoting the 
              right products, thereby enhancing sales. While we may not have a comprehensive understanding 
              of the overall impact of each product, this information empowers the marketing team to 
              strategically tailor their marketing campaigns to drive improved sales performance.

                Figure 15 shows that the p-value is less than 0.05 for all three 
                regions, meaning that the null hypothesis should be rejected and 
                therefore the sales data is not normally distributed.

                  Figure 16 shows us that the skewness values are positive indicating 
                  that the tail is on the right side of distribution and the Kurtosis 
                  is leptokurtic (heavy-tailed), meaning that data produces more outliers 
                  than a normal distribution.<br>
                  If data is not normally distributed it could impact any machine learning 
                  models that we use for predictive analytics. We would need to remove any outliers, 
                  but this could reduce the data sample and so it would be best to get a larger data 
                  set so that we can get a more distribution.<br>
                  To confirm if there are any relationships between North American, 
                  European, and Global sales, we are able to create a linear regression model

                the strongest correlation (91.6%) is between North American Sales and Global Sales. 
                By plotting the relationships, we are able to visualise this relationship (Figure 18).

                As there are multiple variables, a multiple linear regression model

                  The summary statistics for the multiple linear regression show us that we can be very confident with our model; 
                  the p-values are less than 0.05, and the adjusted R-squared value is very high (96.6%). 
                  This tells us that EU_Sales and NA_Sales are highly significant variables in relationship to Global sales.
                  We can use this model to test its ability to predict the global sales and compare with what was actually observed.

                From our analysis, we have been able to identify the key groups of customers shopping at Turtles Games, 
                based on renumeration and spending scores and the best groups to target to boost sales (Groups 1 and 0 from Figure 6).<br>
                Our sentiment analysis demonstrated that customers had predominantly positive sentiments towards the company 
                and the sentiment polarity distribution was more neutral to positive. We were able to identify the highest and 
                lowest selling products for all regions and so Turtles Games will be better informed when it comes to 
                marketing so that they promote the most popular products.<br>
                In terms of relationships relating to sales data, our analysis showed that there was a positive 
                relationship with North American, Europeans sales and Global Sales; although, North American Sales had the 
                strongest relationship with Global sales and so this would be a key market to focus on also. We were able 
                to predict the Global sales with very strong accuracy using a multiple linear regression model. Questions 
                were raised regarding the distribution of the data and so to further our analysis, we would suggest getting 
                data from a bigger sample that is more representative of the normal distribution or data for a longer time frame.
